  - Constructor chaining with super() keyword
  - Method inheritance and code reusability

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any text editor or IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- MySQL Server (for Day 8-9 database examples)
- MySQL JDBC Driver (mysql-connector-java.jar)

### Running the Programs
1. Navigate to the specific day folder
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac filename.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   java filename
   ```

### Special Instructions for GUI and Database Programs:

**For Day 7 (Swing GUI):**
```bash
cd day_7
javac Registration.java
java Registration
```

**For Day 8-9 (Database Programming):**
```bash
cd day_8  # or day_9
# Download MySQL Connector/J first
javac -cp ".:mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar" filename.java
java -cp ".;mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar" filename
```
