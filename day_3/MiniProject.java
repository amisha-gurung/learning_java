// here I'll use what I've learned in past two days and write a java program
// Exercise: Interactive Profile

    Asks the user for their name.

    Asks for their favorite color.

    Prints:
    "Hello, [name]! [color] is a lovely color!"

    Then, asks for their age.

    Prints:
    "Next year, youâ€™ll be [age + 1] years old!"
